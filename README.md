Splitter project 

GOAL
This exercise is aimed at practising with Geth along with Solidity and Truffle to create a small application that will split ehter into two different accounts. The application should also protect users and its contracts from villains.

SETTING
The application will be named "Splitter" whereby:
•	there are 3 people: Alice, Bob and Carol.
•	we can see the balance of the Splitter contract on the Web page.
•	whenever Alice sends ether to the contract for it to be split, half of it goes to Bob and the other half to Carol.
•	we can see the balances of Alice, Bob and Carol on the Web page.
•	Alice can use the Web page to split her ether.
